% Lab #6, problem 1. 
% Problem 1.
% In a study of the size of various computer systems, the random variable
% $X$, the number of files stored (in hundreds of thousands), is considered. If they cannot store at 
% least 9, on average, they don't meet the efficiency standard
% and they have to be replaced. Past experience 
% indicates that sigma = 5. These data are obtained:
%  7  7  4  5  9  9
%  4 12  8  1  8  7
%  3 13  2  1 17  7
% 12  5  6  2  1 13
% 14 10  2  4  9 11
%  3  5 12  6 10  7
% a. Assuming that past experience indicates that sigma = 5, at the 5%
% significance level, does the data suggest that the standard is met? What about at 1%?
% b. Without the assumption on sigma, does the data suggest that on average, the nr
% of files exceeds 5.5? (same sign. level)
